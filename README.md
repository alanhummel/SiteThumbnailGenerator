# Webservice for creating image thumbnails of sites.

Creates image thumbnails of websites. Designed in Java and requires SWT to compile.

This webservice reads a website address, creates a SWT Browser component, renders the site, saves it in an image, resizes it (in a smoothly manner) and returns the data within its own service.
